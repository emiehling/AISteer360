# Installation

The toolkit uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as the package manager (Python 3.12+). For Mac/Linux, `uv` is installed via:

=== "standalone installer"
    ```bash
    curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

=== "Homebrew"
    ```bash
    brew install astral-sh/uv/uv
    ```

For Windows, `uv` can be installed (using PowerShell 7+) via:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

See the uv page for details and other installation options.


## Installing the toolkit

Once `uv` is installed, install the `steerability` package via:

```commandline
uv venv --python 3.12 && uv pip install .
```

The above creates a `.venv` (if missing), installs `steerability` (in non-editable mode), and installs all dependencies
listed under `[project.dependencies]` in the `pyproject.toml` file. Activate the environment by running `source .venv/bin/activate`.
Note that on Windows, you may need to split the installation script into two separate commands (instead of chained via `&&`).
To install an optional dependency group from `[project.optional-dependencies]`, e.g., `docs`, append it in quotes and
square brackets to the `install` command as follows:

```commandline
uv venv --python 3.12 && uv pip install '.[docs]'
```

By default, pipelines load and run the model in process (via Hugging Face `transformers`). The optional feature
extras add:

- `merging`: the MergeKit structural control
- `cpo`: causal DML reward estimation for CPO (which otherwise runs via a gradient-boosting fallback)
- `inspect`: the Inspect AI evaluation framework
- `viz`: matplotlib and seaborn, for the evaluation plotting utilities
- `guided`: xgrammar, for in-process constrained decoding
- `vllm`: the vLLM execution backends (offline engine or server) plus the `vllm_hook_plugins` core. This extra pulls in
  `trl[vllm]` such that the resolved vLLM version stays inside TRL's supported range.

The umbrella `all` extra installs `cpo`, `inspect`, and `viz`. Install `guided`, `merging`, and `vllm` by name, e.g.,
`uv pip install '.[vllm]'`. Note that `merging` cannot share an environment with `inspect` (MergeKit pins an older
pydantic than Inspect requires) and therefore stays out of `all`.

The vLLM boot environment (applied by the offline engine, and returned by `serve_environment()` for a server you
launch) defaults the FlashInfer sampler off via `VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER=0`. This avoids a JIT kernel compile at
boot, which fails on a node whose CUDA toolkit does not match the installed torch build. The native sampler is
greedy-equivalent. To use FlashInfer instead, install its prebuilt kernels for your CUDA version from
`https://flashinfer.ai/whl/cu1XX` (`flashinfer-jit-cache`, and optionally `flashinfer-cubin`) and set
`VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER=1`.

## Accessing Hugging Face models

Inference is facilitated by Hugging Face. Before steering, create a `.env` file in the root directory for your Hugging
Face API key in the following format:
```
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=hf_***
```

Some Hugging Face models (e.g. `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`) are behind an access gate. To gain access:

1. Request access on the model's Hub page with the same account whose token you use in your `.env` file.
2. Wait for approval (you'll receive an email).
3. (Re-)authenticate locally by running `huggingface-cli login`.

Once you have completed the above steps, please see our [quickstart](quickstart.md) guide to get up and running!

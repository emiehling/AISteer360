    "**Paper**: [Inference-Time Intervention: Eliciting Truthful Answers from a Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03341)\n",

    "**Authors**: Kenneth Li, Oam Patel, Fernanda Viégas, Hanspeter Pfister, Martin Wattenberg\n",
    "\n",
    "Inference-Time Intervention (ITI) is a state control method that steers model behavior by shifting activations at a sparse set of attention heads during generation. ITI targets individual attention heads across multiple layers (compared to methods that intervene on the full residual stream at a single layer, e.g., CAA, ActAdd). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we outline how ITI can be used to steer the model toward increased truthfulness. Heads are selected by training per-head linear probes on labeled true/false statements, ranking them by probe accuracy, and intervening only on the top-K heads. The intervention adds a scaled \"truthful direction\" (mass mean shift) to each selected head's slice of the residual stream at every generated token."

    "### Steering with ITI\n",
    "\n",
    "We now create an ITI-steered pipeline. The procedure during `steer()` is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For every attention head across all layers (32 layers × 32 heads = 1,024 heads for LLaMA-7B), attention output activations are extracted on the true/false training pairs.\n",
    "2. A logistic regression probe is trained per head to classify true vs. false statements. The probe's validation accuracy measures how strongly that head encodes truthfulness.\n",
    "3. The top-K heads (by probe accuracy) are selected for intervention.\n",
    "4. For each selected head, the \"truthful direction\" is computed as the mass mean shift: `mean(activations_true) - mean(activations_false)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At generation time, for each selected (layer, head) pair, `alpha * sigma * theta_hat` is added to that head's slice at the input to the output projection (pre-o_proj), where `theta_hat` is the L2-normalized direction and `sigma` is the standard deviation of activations projected onto that direction. We use `num_heads=48` and `alpha=15.0` (the paper's defaults for LLaMA-7B). The original paper also supports using the logistic regression probe's weight vector (`probe.coef_`) as the intervention direction; the center-of-mass (mass mean shift) direction used here is the recommended default."

    "\n",
    "A key finding from the ITI paper is that truthfulness information is encoded sparsely across attention heads. Most heads have near-chance probe accuracy (~50%), while a small fraction show strong accuracy (up to ~80%+). This pattern of specialization is visible in the probe accuracy heatmap below (mirrors Figure 2(A) from the paper)."

    "The probe accuracy heatmap above reveals why ITI's head selection strategy works. Each cell shows the cross-validated accuracy of a logistic regression probe trained to distinguish truthful from untruthful statements using that head's activations. Heads with accuracy near 50% (chance level) carry no useful signal about truthfulness, while heads with 70-80%+ accuracy have learned representations where the truthful/untruthful distinction is linearly separable. ITI intervenes only on this high-accuracy subset (since steering on the less informative heads would essentially just introduce noise)."

    "\n",
    "The ITI paper's primary evaluation uses two multiple-choice metrics from TruthfulQA rather than open-ended generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MC1** (single-true accuracy): Given a question with one correct answer and several incorrect answers, MC1 is 1.0 if the model assigns highest probability to the correct answer, else 0.0.\n",
    "- **MC2** (multi-true normalized probability): Given a question with multiple correct and incorrect answers, MC2 computes the fraction of total probability mass assigned to correct answers: `sum(p_correct) / (sum(p_correct) + sum(p_incorrect))`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both metrics require computing the length-normalized conditional log-likelihood of each candidate answer given the prompt. We use the toolkit's `SteeringPipeline.compute_logprobs` for this, which applies all steering hooks during the forward pass. Length normalization (dividing total log-prob by token count) prevents bias toward shorter answers."

    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated Inference-Time Intervention (ITI) for steering a language model toward truthfulness. Evaluation was performed using the paper's MC1/MC2 (likelihood-ranking) metrics which measure whether the model assigns higher probability to true answers than false ones. The per-category breakdown reveals which types of questions benefit most from steering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach generalizes to other concepts beyond truthfulness. Given any binary classification task with labeled examples (e.g., toxic/non-toxic, formal/informal), one can train per-head probes, select high-accuracy heads, and apply the same mass-mean-shift intervention. The main requirement is that the target property be linearly separable in at least some attention heads' activation space."

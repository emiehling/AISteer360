    "\n",
    "Inference-Time Intervention (ITI) is a state control method that steers model behavior by shifting activations at a sparse set of attention heads during generation. ITI targets individual attention heads across multiple layers (compared to methods that intervene on the full residual stream at a single layer, e.g., CAA, ActAdd). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we outline how ITI can be used to steer the model toward increased truthfulness. Heads are selected by training per-head linear probes on labeled true/false statements, ranking them by probe accuracy, and intervening only on the top-K heads. The intervention adds a scaled \"truthful direction\" (mass mean shift) to each selected head's slice of the residual stream at every generated token."

    "### Steering with ITI\n",
    "\n",
    "We now create an ITI-steered pipeline. The procedure during `steer()` is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For every attention head across all layers (32 layers × 32 heads = 1,024 heads for LLaMA-7B), attention output activations are extracted on the true/false training pairs.\n",
    "2. A logistic regression probe is trained per head to classify true vs. false statements. The probe's validation accuracy measures how strongly that head encodes truthfulness.\n",
    "3. The top-K heads (by probe accuracy) are selected for intervention.\n",
    "4. For each selected head, the \"truthful direction\" is computed as the mass mean shift: `mean(activations_true) - mean(activations_false)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At generation time, for each selected (layer, head) pair, `alpha * sigma * theta_hat` is added to that head's slice at the input to the output projection (pre-o_proj), where `theta_hat` is the L2-normalized direction and `sigma` is the standard deviation of activations projected onto that direction. We use the paper's default hyperparameters: `num_heads=48` and `alpha=15.0`. Additionally, note that original paper also supports using the logistic regression probe's weight vector (`probe.coef_`) as the intervention direction; the center-of-mass (mass mean shift) direction used here is the recommended default."

    "\n",
    "A key finding from the ITI paper is that truthfulness information is encoded sparsely across attention heads. Most heads have near-chance probe accuracy (~50%), while a small fraction show strong accuracy (up to ~80%+). This pattern of specialization is visible in the probe accuracy heatmap below (mirrors Figure 2(A) from the paper)."

    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated Inference-Time Intervention (ITI) for steering a language model toward more truthful answers. Following the [original ITI implementation](https://github.com/likenneth/honest_llama), the experiment used the generation split of TruthfulQA and flattened all correct/incorrect answers into individual QA pairs with binary labels (~5,918 total examples). Questions were split at the question level to prevent leakage between direction-finding and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Per-head logistic regression probes were trained to identify the sparse set of attention heads that encode truthfulness. At inference time, activations were shifted at the top-48 heads along their truthful directions (mass mean shift), which reduced the model's tendency to produce common misconceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same approach generalizes to other concepts by substituting different labeled datasets. The intervention strength (`alpha`) and number of heads (`num_heads`) can be tuned to balance truthfulness against fluency; the paper identifies a trade-off where higher `alpha` improves truthfulness but may reduce helpfulness."

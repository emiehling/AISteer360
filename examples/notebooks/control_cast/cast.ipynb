    "CAST (conditional activation steering) is an activation steering method (and more broadly a state control method in our toolkit) that extends existing activation steering techniques with the introduction of condition vectors, enabling fine-grained control over model behavior without the need for fine-tuning or extensive computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we show how CAST can induce refusal behavior when asked questions related to legal matters. As will be shown, CAST does this via both a behavior vector and a condition vector (on topics related to law) to detect when to trigger the desired behavior. "

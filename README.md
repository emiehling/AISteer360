Welcome to AI Steerability 360 (AISteer360), a toolkit for steering large language models.

AISteer360 provides an expressive library of reusable components (termed generics) across four model control surfaces
(input, structural, state, and output). This allows for the modular construction of novel steering methods, composition
of steering methods into steering pipelines, and benchmarking of pipelines on custom use cases and metrics (including
measurement of steering side effects).

To get started, please see the documentation at <https://ibm.github.io/AISteer360/> and the [example notebooks](examples/index.md).

## Installation

The toolkit uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as the package manager (Python 3.11+). After installing `uv`, install
the toolkit by running:

```commandline
uv venv --python 3.11 && uv pip install .
```
Activate by running `source .venv/bin/activate`. Note that on Windows, you may need to split the above script into two
separate commands (instead of chained via `&&`).

Optional features are available via extra. Install everything with `uv pip install ".[all]"`.

Inference is facilitated by Hugging Face by default. Before steering, create a `.env` file in the root directory for
your Hugging Face API key in the following format:
```
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=hf_***
```

Some Hugging Face models (e.g. `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`) are behind an access gate. Check that you have
access via the model's Hub page with the same account whose token you pass to the toolkit.

## Execution backends

### Hugging Face (default)

By default, pipelines load and run the model in process via Hugging Face `transformers`. Run
the toolkit from a machine with enough GPU memory for the base checkpoint plus the overhead
your steering method or pipeline adds.

### vLLM (offline engine or server)

Install the extra with `uv pip install ".[vllm]"`. Two modes are available. The offline
engine boots vLLM inside your process, with no server to manage:

```python
from aisteer360.algorithms.core.execution import BackendSpec

pipeline = SteeringPipeline(
    controls=[...],
    backend=BackendSpec(kind="vllm", model="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"),
    steer_backend="huggingface",  # training/fitting stays on Hugging Face
    lazy_init=True,
)
```

Alternatively, target a running vLLM server (local or remote). Launch one with
`vllm serve meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --port 8000`, then:

```python
pipeline = SteeringPipeline(
    controls=[...],
    backend=BackendSpec(
        kind="vllm-serve",
        model="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
        options={"base_url": "http://localhost:8000"},
    ),
    steer_backend="huggingface",
    lazy_init=True,
)
```

Steering (training, fitting) runs on the Hugging Face backend via `steer_backend`; inference
executes on the engine or server. Support is per control and backend, and `pipeline.check()`
reports unsupported combinations before any work happens; see the compatibility matrix in
[docs/reference/backends.md](docs/reference/backends.md).

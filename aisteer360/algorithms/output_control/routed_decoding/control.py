class RoutedDecoding(PhasedDriver):
    """Decoding driver that routes each prompt to a response strategy via probe decisions.

    `RoutedDecoding` pairs a `ProbeSet` (named calibrated probes scored in one read-only
    forward) with a `RoutingRules` set (ordered boolean rules over the probe names, first match
    wins, evaluated per row). Decoding proceeds in three steps:

    1. **Probe pass**: one read-only forward of the prompt, issued by `ProbeSet.read()`, yields
       each probe's per-row signed score and decision (`score >= 0`).
    2. **Routing**: the decisions feed `rules.route()`, matching each row to its first
       satisfied rule (or the default).
    3. **Execution**: each row's action is lowered to a phase plan and executed by the
       inherited plan runner. `Respond(text)` splices the canned tokens with no generation;
       `Prefix(text)` splices the prefix then generates; `Generate()` delegates the row to
       `model.generate`. A raw `list[Fixed | Generated]` is also accepted as an action. The
       composed logits processors and stopping criteria apply in every generated phase, so the
       driver contract is preserved.

    The probes arrive fitted (a `ProbeSet`) or as a deferred recipe (a `ProbeSetFit`) that
    `steer()` fits on the model the pipeline provides, so pipelines whose structural controls
    produce the final weights fit on those weights. A fitted set whose recorded model
    fingerprints differ from the pipeline's model raises at `steer()` unless
    `allow_model_mismatch=True`.

    The read wraps its forward in `auxiliary_pass(aligned=True)`, the standard marking for
    same-model forwards issued during decoding (`same_model_forwards = True`). Its capture
    hooks are closures registered for the duration of that single forward and are removed
    before decoding begins, so the re-processing of the prompt inside generated phases is
    never re-scored.

    Costs per row: a routed canned response costs one prompt forward and zero decode steps; a
    pass-through row costs one extra prompt forward compared to the default driver.

    When state controls carrying behavior transforms share the pipeline, their hooks are live
    during the probe pass. The pass is trajectory-aligned, so `"all"`-scope transforms, and
    position-scoped ones covering prompt positions, apply to it, and probe scores are measured
    under that steering; `token_scope="after_prompt"` transforms are inert (the pass contains
    only prompt positions). Those controls' condition scorers, gates, and position counters
    ignore the pass entirely, since it is auxiliary.

    Padding is handled per row: pad positions are stripped (via the attention mask) before plan
    execution, and each returned row is the original padded prompt plus its continuation, so
    the pipeline's prompt-length slicing stays exact.

    The most recent routing outcome is retained on `latest_routes` (one rule name per row,
    `"default"` for unmatched rows); per-probe decisions and scores are available on the probe
    set's `latest` readout.

    `runtime_kwargs`:

    - `"canned_responses"`: dict mapping rule names to replacement text, overriding the
      `Respond`/`Prefix` text of matching rules for this call only. Keys that do not name a
      `Respond`/`Prefix` rule are ignored with a warning.
    - `"base_generate"`: replacement for `model.generate` inside generated phases.

"""Output control base classes.

Output controls participate in decoding through two mechanisms:

- Logits-processor composition: each control's `get_logits_processors()` results are gathered in
  pipeline `controls` list order and composed by `LogitsProcessorList`.
- Stopping-criteria composition: each control's `get_stopping_criteria()` results are gathered the
  same way; generation stops when any criterion fires.
- The decode loop is exclusive: it is implemented by exactly one `DecodingDriver`, which receives
  the composed stacks as explicit parameters and must apply them at every scoring step of every
  forward pass it issues.

Examples of output controls:

- Reward-augmented decoding (a step-level control)
- Self-disciplined autoregressive sampling (a step-level control)
- Decoding-time alignment / lookahead search (a decoding driver)
- Phase splicing / thinking intervention (a decoding driver)

"""State control base classes.

This module provides the abstract base class for methods that register hooks into the model (e.g., to modify
intermediate representations during inference); does not change model weights.

Two base classes are provided:

- `StateControl`: Base class for all state control methods.
- `NoStateControl`: Identity (null) control; used when no state control is defined in steering pipeline.

State controls implement steering through runtime intervention in the model's forward pass, modifying internal states
(activations, attention patterns) to produce generations following y ~ p_θᵃ(x), where "p_θᵃ" is the model with state
controls.

Examples of state controls:

- Activation steering (e.g., adding direction vectors)
- Attention head manipulation and pruning
- Layer-wise activation editing
- Dynamic routing between components
- Representation engineering techniques

The base class provides automatic hook management through context managers (ensures cleanup and avoids memory leaks).

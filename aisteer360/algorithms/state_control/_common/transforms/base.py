    """Applies a modification to hidden states at a given layer.

    All transforms receive:
        - hidden_states shaped [B, T, H]
        - the layer_id so the transform can index per-layer artifacts
        - a token_mask shaped [B, T] (True where the transform should apply)

    Transforms MUST NOT modify hidden_states in-place if the original tensor
    is needed later (e.g., for norm-preserving wrappers); return a new tensor.

    Artifact-carrying transforms take their artifact as the first positional argument, typed
    `SteeringVector | Mapping[int, Tensor] | ArtifactSource` and **required**. A concrete artifact
    binds the transform immediately (validated at `__init__`); an `ArtifactSource` leaves it
    *unbound* until `bind(ctx)` resolves the source (validated then). Subclass recipe:

        - store the concrete artifact and set `is_bound=True`, or store the source and set
          `is_bound=False`;
        - override `bind(ctx)` to return a **freshly constructed** bound instance (never mutate
          `self`, never `copy.copy` — derived caches would go stale);
        - override `covered_layer_ids` to report the layers the (bound) artifact covers;
        - call `self._require_bound()` as the first line of `apply`.

    Transforms with no steering artifact keep the defaults (always bound, no coverage).

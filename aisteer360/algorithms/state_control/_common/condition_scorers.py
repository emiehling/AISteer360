"""Condition scoring for the steering runtime's condition path.

A condition scorer maps a layer's hidden states to per-row condition scores:

    scorer(hidden [B, T, H], layer_id, *, prompt_mask [B, T] | None) -> Tensor [B]

`prompt_mask` is the pad-aware prompt attention mask (True at real tokens) and is supplied by
the runtime only on the prefill pass; on decode passes it is None and `hidden` is the newly
generated token(s). `B` here is the batch the hook observes (possibly beam-expanded); the
runtime collapses scores down to logical rows before feeding the gate. Returning a python
float is permitted only for single-prompt generation; for batches, scorers must return per-row
scores.

This module holds the `ConditionScorer` protocol, the packaged scorers
(`CosineDirectionScorer`, `ProjectedCosineScorer`, `ProbeContributionScorer`), the
`probe_condition()` factory that assembles a fitted probe into `ActivationAdapter`
condition-port kwargs, and the score math shared with `selectors/condition_point.py` so that
selector calibration and runtime scoring provably agree.

    The score is signed, unlike `ProjectedCosineScorer` whose score is approximately

    score low, and unrelated content scores near zero, so a `"larger"` threshold fails closed on
    out-of-distribution inputs. Prefer this scorer for topic or domain gates whose calibration
    negatives cannot cover the deployment input space. Signed scores can be negative, so pair it
    with a `ConditionSearchSpec.threshold_range` that admits negative values, e.g. `(-1.0, 1.0)`.

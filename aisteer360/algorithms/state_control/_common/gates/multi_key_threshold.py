class MultiKeyThresholdGate(BaseGate):
    """Row-vectorized gate that opens based on threshold comparison of received scores.

    Supports multiple condition layers (keys). Each `update()` records a per-row pass/fail
    decision for that key, and `open_rows()` aggregates across keys with "any"/"all" semantics,
    elementwise per row. Rows are gated independently, so one batched generation can steer some
    prompts and not others.

    The gate retains the raw per-key score tensors (`evidence()`) so callers can surface
    diagnostics without re-deriving them in hook code.

    Comparator semantics are inverted relative to the reference implementation at
    github.com/IBM/activation-steering. Here "larger" opens the gate when the score is
    greater than or equal to the threshold. Any (layer, threshold, comparator) tuple copied
    from the paper or the reference repository must flip the comparator. Prefer the aliases
    "score_above" and "score_below".

    The class names the `multi_key_threshold` wire kind, but no configuration of this gate
    exports (`export()` stays None): the wire kind decides from per-row affine evidence over
    uploaded weight vectors, while this gate thresholds scores computed by an arbitrary
    scorer, so the gating runs in process.

    Args:
        threshold: Score threshold for comparison.
        comparator: "larger"/"score_above" opens the gate when score >= threshold;
            "smaller"/"score_below" opens when score <= threshold.
        expected_keys: Set of keys (layer_ids) the gate expects to hear from. Drives
            `is_ready()`: the gate is ready once every expected key has reported. If None,
            the gate is ready after the first update.
        aggregate: "any" opens a row if any key passes for that row. "all" requires all keys.

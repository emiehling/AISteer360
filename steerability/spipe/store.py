"""Content-addressed artifact store backing frozen `.spipe` bundles.

The store is a directory of artifact directories, each named by its content id. Two encodings
exist: `"tensors"` (a single `artifact.safetensors`, id and bytes produced by `artifact_id_for`
from `state_control/common/lowering.py`, byte-compatible with the vLLM-Hook plugin registry)
and `"tree"` (a directory copied verbatim under `payload/`, id a SHA-256 over the sorted
relative paths and per-file digests). Every artifact directory carries an `artifact.json`
sidecar duplicating its manifest record plus type-specific reconstruction metadata, which
keeps a detached artifact directory self-describing. Writes are idempotent and reads verify the
content hash.

"""`SPipe`: a portable serialization of a `SteeringPipeline`.

One format holds both the recipe and the frozen resolution. A recipe-only spipe carries the
model reference and the controls as constructed; loading it and calling `steer()` re-runs
fits. A frozen spipe additionally pins what the resolution produced (fingerprints, resolved
bindings, per-fit digests) in a lock section and stores the products content-addressed. The
loaded controls therefore steer cheaply and model-free. The frozen form is itself a valid
recipe, since every resolved entry is constructor-valid for its method and loading takes the
ordinary construction and `steer()` path.

        Under `prefer="frozen"`, an entry with a resolved section is instantiated from it, with

        Each control's `enabled` flag is copied from the entry. `pipeline()` calls this method

        With `lenient=True`, the entry is decoded for inspection (e.g., of `steer_access()` or

class XGrammarAutomaton:
    """A `ConstraintAutomaton` that tracks a separate xgrammar grammar state for each row of a batch.

    `compile_constraint_automaton()` builds an automaton from a `ConstraintSource`. `fresh()` returns a new automaton
    over the same compiled grammar with no row state, optionally with the prompts of a generation. `allowed()`
    returns the tokens that the grammar permits next in each row.

    The constrained output of a row is the part of the row after its prompt. The prompts start as the rows passed to
    `fresh()`, or as the rows of the first call when none are passed. Leading pad tokens are removed before rows are
    compared, since a decoding driver may pad a row differently between calls. A prompt counts as decoded once a
    row's output has begun at its end in an earlier call. The grammar state of each row in a call is determined as
    follows:

    1. **Continued rows**: a row that begins with a row of the previous call continues that row's output. This covers
       ordinary decode steps, reordered beams, and several candidates that continue one row.
    2. **Replayed rows**: a row that begins with no row of the previous call replays its output from the longest
       prompt it begins with. This applies when that prompt has been decoded and the grammar accepts the row's next
       token after it (e.g., a rewind to a shorter prefix, or a candidate that decodes after another candidate of its
       prompt).
    3. **New prompts**: any other row is treated as a prompt, and its constrained output begins after it (e.g., a
       prompt followed by text inserted before the first generated token).

    A row that begins with a row of the previous call is also treated as a prompt when the longest prompt it begins
    with is longer than that row and has not been decoded (e.g., a later prompt that begins with an earlier prompt
    and its output). In a batched call, every prompt is decoded on the first call. A row whose own output reaches
    another prompt in a batched call therefore continues its output.

    After the grammar rejects one of a row's tokens (e.g., text inserted by a decoding driver after generated tokens),
    or once the grammar has terminated, only the stop tokens are permitted for that row.

    Rows are identified by their token ids alone, which leads to the following behavior when prompts overlap:

    - When the prompts decode one at a time (e.g., under `seed_scope="item"`), a row whose own output reaches a
      longer prompt that has not been decoded yet restarts its grammar at the end of that prompt.
    - Without prompts passed to `fresh()`, a later prompt that begins with an earlier prompt and its output continues
      that output.

    An automaton tracks one generation at a time. `ConstrainedDecoding` calls `fresh()` with the prompts of each
    generation to create the automaton for that generation.

        compiled: The compiled xgrammar grammar.

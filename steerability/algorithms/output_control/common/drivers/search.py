class SearchDriver(DecodingDriver):
    """Decoding driver that extends each prompt one segment at a time and keeps the highest-scoring continuations.

    `SearchDriver` is constructed with the arguments listed under `Args:`. Alternatively, a subclass
    sets an `Args` dataclass and overrides `_configure()` to set these fields, and the constructor
    then validates the subclass's `Args`. For each prompt row, with pad positions removed, a search
    repeats three steps:

    1. **Proposal**: `num_candidates` continuations of at most `segment_len` tokens are generated
       through the session from each sequence in the frontier, which starts as the prompt. With
       `propose_mode="beam"`, the continuations are the returned beams of a beam search with
       `num_candidates` beams. With `propose_mode="sample"`, they are sampled.
    2. **Scoring**: the scorer receives the decoded prompt, the decoded continuations (all text after
       the prompt), and the row's scoring parameters, and returns one score per continuation.
    3. **Selection**: the `keep_k` highest-scoring sequences are kept. The kept sequences that are
       finished leave the frontier, and the unfinished ones form the next frontier.

    The search stops after `max_iterations` iterations, when every kept sequence is finished, or when
    the token budget is used up. It returns the highest-scoring sequence seen in any iteration.

    The caller's `max_new_tokens` is the token budget of each search, and no returned continuation is
    longer than it. Each rollout generates at most `segment_len` tokens, and at most the budget minus
    the width of the frontier's continuations, which are right-padded to a common length. The
    caller's `min_new_tokens` applies to each rollout and is reduced to the rollout's length when
    larger. A kept sequence is finished when its continuation, with trailing pad tokens removed, ends
    in an eos token or reaches the budget. The eos ids are the tokenizer's eos id and the ids on the
    model's generation config. When the pad token is an eos id, a sequence with trailing pad tokens
    is also finished. A sequence that a caller's stop rule ended (a stopping criterion, stop string,
    or stop token id) is otherwise unfinished, and the search continues it.

    When the proposals sample, a call with `num_return_sequences=n` runs `n` searches per row. Each
    search is seeded differently, since each session call derives its own seeds. Proposals in sample
    mode always sample. In beam mode, they sample only when the call passes `do_sample=True`, or
    passes no `do_sample` and the model's generation config samples. Without sampling, the driver
    runs one search per row and returns its result as each of the row's `n` candidates. Each returned
    row is the padded prompt row followed by one search's best continuation, right-padded to a common
    length. Rows are ordered by prompt row and then by candidate.

    `whole_batch_rollouts` is False because each search runs on one row. With enabled in-process
    state controls, the pipeline accepts one prompt row per call.

    The following `runtime_kwargs` are accepted:

    - `"reward_params"`: A mapping of entries added to the scorer's `params` on every scoring call
      for the row. A single mapping applies to every row, and a sequence contains one mapping per
      row. The scorer's `params` also contain `segment_len`, `num_candidates`, `keep_k`, and
      `max_iterations`, which take precedence over entries of the same name.

    Args:
        scorer: A `SequenceScorer`, i.e., a callable `(prompt, continuations, params) -> list[float]`
            that returns one score per continuation, with higher scores preferred.
        segment_len: Maximum number of new tokens per rollout, or None to use the call's
            `max_new_tokens`.
        num_candidates: Number of continuations proposed from each frontier sequence per iteration.
        keep_k: Number of sequences kept after each iteration.
        max_iterations: Maximum number of search iterations.
        propose_mode: `"beam"` (default) or `"sample"`.

    Attributes:
        tokenizer: The tokenizer that decodes prompts and continuations, attached by the pipeline or
            by a subclass's `steer()`, or None before it is attached.

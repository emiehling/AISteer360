    """Implementation of DeAL (Decoding-time Alignment) from Huang et al., 2024.

    DeAL aligns generation with an objective at inference time through a lookahead search guided by a
    reward function. Each search iteration has three steps:

    1. **Lookahead**: beam search generates `init_beams` continuations of up to `lookahead` tokens
       from each sequence in the frontier, which starts as the prompt.
    2. **Scoring**: `reward_func` scores each continuation for the objective (e.g., helpfulness or
       safety).
    3. **Selection**: the `topk` highest-scoring sequences are kept, and the unfinished ones form the
       next frontier.

    The search stops after `max_iterations` iterations, when every kept sequence is finished (it ends
    in an eos token or reaches `max_new_tokens`), or when no token budget is left. DeAL returns the
    highest-scoring sequence seen in any iteration.

    The `reward_func` argument accepts a callable `(prompt, continuations, params) -> list[float]`
    that returns one score per continuation, with higher scores preferred. Each continuation is the
    decoded text after the prompt. The `lookahead` (default 10), `init_beams` (default 5), `topk`
    (default 3), and `max_iterations` (default 10) arguments must be positive integers, and `topk`
    must not exceed `init_beams`.

    The composed logits processors and stopping criteria apply in every lookahead rollout, and a
    step-level control such as RAD steers every rollout. Without sampling, beam search is
    deterministic. The `num_return_sequences` candidates of a prompt then come from a single search
    and are identical. Beam proposals require a backend with `Capability.BEAM_PROPOSALS`.

    The following `runtime_kwargs` are accepted:

    - `"reward_params"`: A mapping of entries added to the `params` passed to `reward_func` on every
      scoring call for the row. A single mapping applies to every row, and a sequence contains one
      mapping per row.

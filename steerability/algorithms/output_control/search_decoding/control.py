class SearchDecoding(SearchDriver):
    """Decoding driver that runs a configured segment search over continuations.

    `SearchDecoding` extends each prompt one segment at a time. Each iteration proposes
    `num_candidates` continuations of up to `segment_len` tokens from each kept sequence, scores them
    with the scorer, and keeps the `keep_k` highest-scoring sequences. The search runs for at most
    `max_iterations` iterations and returns the highest-scoring sequence seen in any iteration.

    The `scorer` argument accepts a `SequenceScorer`, i.e., a callable
    `(prompt, continuations, params) -> list[float]` such as a function, a `MajorityVoteScorer`, or a
    `SampleSequenceScorer`. It also accepts a dict with a `"kind"` key, either `"reward_model"` (with
    a `model_id`) or `"majority_vote"`. `steer()` resolves a dict, and a `"reward_model"` dict loads
    its model onto the device of the pipeline's model. The `propose_mode` argument is `"sample"`
    (default) or `"beam"`. `segment_len=None` (default) uses the call's `max_new_tokens` as the
    segment length. The integer arguments must be positive, and `keep_k` must not exceed
    `num_candidates`.

    The defaults (`num_candidates=8`, `keep_k=1`, `max_iterations=1`, and sampled proposals) give
    best-of-N, which samples `num_candidates` full-length continuations once and returns the one with
    the highest score. Methods from the literature correspond to the following settings:

    - Best-of-N: the defaults with `scorer={"kind": "reward_model", "model_id": ...}` or any callable.
    - Self-consistency: the defaults with `scorer={"kind": "majority_vote"}`.
    - Blockwise controlled decoding: `segment_len=block` and `max_iterations=ceil(budget / block)`.
    - Scorer-guided reranking: the defaults with `scorer=SampleSequenceScorer(row_scorer)`.
    - DeAL: `propose_mode="beam"`, `segment_len=lookahead`, `num_candidates=init_beams`,
      `keep_k=topk`, and the DeAL `max_iterations`.

    The composed logits processors and stopping criteria apply in every rollout, and a step-level
    control such as `ValueGuidance` steers every proposed continuation. A call with
    `num_return_sequences=n` runs `n` searches per row. In beam mode without sampling, one search
    runs per row and its result is returned as each of the `n` candidates.

    The following `runtime_kwargs` are accepted:

    - `"reward_params"`: A mapping of entries added to the scorer's `params` on every scoring call
      for the row. A single mapping applies to every row, and a sequence contains one mapping per
      row.

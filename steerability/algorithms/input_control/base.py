"""Input control base class.

This module provides `InputControl`, the abstract base class for methods that modify prompts before they reach the
model.

Input controls steer through a prompt transformation σ(x) and do not change model parameters or architecture.
Generations then follow y ~ p_θ(σ(x)).

Examples of input controls:

- Few-shot learning (prepending examples)
- Prompt templates and formatting
- Soft prompts and prompt tuning
- Chain-of-thought prompting
- Iterative prompt refinement

    """Abstract base class for input control steering methods.

    Transforms a prompt before it reaches the model, steering behavior via the input alone (no changes to weights,
    architecture, or runtime activations). Any preparation happens once in `steer()`; `adapt()` / `adapt_messages()`
    are a function of the input and the prepared state at inference time.

    A pipeline may hold several input controls; they chain in `controls`-list order, each control receiving the
    previous control's output within its phase (message-level for chat input, then token-level).

    Methods:
        adapt(input_ids, runtime_kwargs) -> input_ids: Tensor-level adaptation (required).
        adapt_messages(messages, runtime_kwargs) -> messages | None: Optional message-level adaptation,
            called BEFORE chat-template tokenization. Default returns None (no change).
        steer(model, tokenizer, **kwargs) -> None: One-time preparation (optional).
        cleanup() -> None: Release resources allocated during steer (optional).

    Subclasses that produce an artifact in `steer()` (instructions, demonstrations, learned weights, ...) may expose it
    via the `memory` attribute, e.g., see `TextMemory`.
